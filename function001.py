#Functions are methods that are created by us for our use cases.
#By using functions we can add different types of methods.
#Lets do an example to show how we use a function>
def name_function():
    print('hello')
#Up here we just created a function.
#'def' is the keyword used to create a function.
#when we call the function,it is going to print the word 'hello'.
name_function()
#We can also create some other function like addition function.
def add(number1,number2):
    return number1+number2
y=add(15,12)
