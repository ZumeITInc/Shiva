#Tuples are very similar to lists.
#However they have a one key difference that is immutability.
#Once an element is inside a tuple it cannot be reassigned
#Tuples use parenthesis:()
t1=(1,2,3)
print(type(t1))
list1=[1,2,3]
print(type(list1))
len(t1)
#similar to the lists we can enter different types of datatypes in the tuple.
t2=('one',1,'q')
print(t2,t1)
